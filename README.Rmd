## What is this?

R switched to using HTML5 in R 4.2.0, and CRAN has started enforcing that packages on CRAN generate valid HTML5.
In a few cases, roxygen2 was generating invalid HTML5 or, more specifically, was generating `.Rd` files that give rise to invalid HTML5.
Many maintainers have been notified that they need to fix this to keep their package safely on CRAN.
**We expect that simply updating roxygen2 to its latest CRAN version (7.2.1), redocumenting (regenerating your `.Rd` files), and then sending your package back in is enough to fix 99.9% of the issues you might see.**

However, we also know that you might want to validate that the issue is fixed, so **this repo provides a Github Actions workflow file that you can use to reproduce the issues and confirm that they have been resolved. Follow the instructions in the next section to understand how you can use it.**

The note from CRAN looks something like:

```
In particular, please see the "Found the following HTML validation
problems" NOTEs in the "HTML version of manual" check for the r-devel
debian checks results.  
```

Additionally, it would be nice to compile a table of the issues and whether or not updating roxygen2 fixes the problem. I've started the table below with my specific issue, but feel free to send a PR with your own specific issues.

## How do I use it?

- Update roxygen2 to 7.2.1

  ``` r
  install.packages("roxygen2")
  ```

- Create a branch to fix the HTML5 issues on

  ``` r
  usethis::pr_init("fix/invalid-html5")
  ```

- Download and commit the Github Actions workflow file that allows you to check for this issue.

  ``` r
  usethis::use_github_action(url = "https://github.com/DavisVaughan/extrachecks-html5/blob/main/R-CMD-check-HTML5.yaml")
  ```
  
  After downloading it, make sure to commit it.
  
- Push the workflow file and go ahead and open the PR, the build should fail, and should tell you where you have HTML issues.

  ``` r
  usethis::pr_push()
  ```
  
- Redocument your package now that you have roxygen2 7.2.1, which should fix most issues.

  ``` r
  devtools::document()
  ```
  
  Commit the changes and push.
  
- In 99.9% of cases, just updating roxygen2 is enough. There are some cases where you will have to do more work manually. We are attempting to capture all issues in the table below. Please open an issue or submit a PR if you have an issue that is not yet captured.

- Once everything is working, remove the workflow file from the PR, merge it, and then finish up locally with:

  ``` r
  usethis::pr_finish()
  ```

## Specific issues

Issue | Notes | Solved by updating roxygen2?
----- | ----- | ----------------------------
`Warning: <img> attribute "align" not allowed for HTML5` | The logo in the package doc md file needs to use a `style` attribute rather than `align="center"`. | yes


## Locally checking

I have an Intel Mac and I was able to locally reproduce the HTML5 issues with the following command using _the development version of R_:

``` r
rcmdcheck::rcmdcheck(env = c("_R_CHECK_RD_VALIDATE_RD2HTML_" = "TRUE"))
```

Note that I needed a relatively new version of the HTML tool `tidy`, which I got with:

```
brew install tidy-html5
```

To install the development version of R, I used [rig](https://github.com/r-lib/rig).

```
rig add devel
# Note that on Intel Mac I needed to use this instead because the default
# devel version rig downloads wasn't new enough:
# rig add https://files.r-hub.io/macos/R-devel.pkg

rig default 4.3
```

You will need to install all the packages required to check your package, so open RStudio to your package directory and run:

``` r
pak::pak()
```

pak is installed automatically by rig and this will install all the packages required to check with rcmdcheck.

## Specifics about the workflow

Note that the workflow is a little slow, due to having to install pdflatex. It also errors on all NOTEs, rather than just on WARNINGs and ERRORs (to catch the HTML issue), so you might get new failures that you previously weren't aware of.

- This check is only in the development version of R, so `r-version` is set to `"devel"` and we are using `ubuntu-latest` as the OS.

- `_R_CHECK_RD_VALIDATE_RD2HTML_=TRUE` is the environment variable that is set to trigger this check. This check only generates a NOTE, so to force rcmdcheck to fail here we set `error-on: '"note"'`.

- To check the HTML manual, we have to actually build it. This is typically not done by default, so there are a few things we have to do:

  - `args: '"--as-cran"'` is set to change the default away from `c("--no-manual", "--as-cran")'`
  
  - `build_args: 'character()'` is set to change the default away from `build_args: '"--no-manual"'`
  
  - pdflatex is installed to build the PDF version of the manual. It seems like you have to build both the PDF and HTML version of the manual, there is no way to attempt to build just one of them.
  
  - tidy is installed to check the HTML version of the manual.
